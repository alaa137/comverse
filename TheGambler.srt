1
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,646
So,

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,448
what are you gonna do for me?

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,164
We're going to be straight
that I've had it.

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,971
What do you say to the fact that...

5
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,484
I'm gonna die?

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,968
I'm going to miss you.

7
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,170
Fuck that.

8
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,522
I won't know about that.

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,001
I need to know

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,524
what you're worth
when I leave you nothing.

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,691
Who wants the world at their feet?

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,202
It's confusing, isn't it?

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,890
I'll do the best I can.
You can go knowing that, okay?

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,889
You're me now...

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,684
If you'll have it.

16
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,844
$10,000?

17
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,051
Player wins.

18
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,885
$20,000?

19
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,571
Player wins.

20
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,445
<i>$40,000?</i>

21
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,525
Player wins.

22
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,841
Again.

23
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,081
Again!

24
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,841
Double it. Make it $80,000.

25
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,290
Come on. Mister Lee can cover
a lot more than that, buddy.

26
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,885
You must be new. Double it!

27
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,490
$80,000.

28
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,561
I hope you paid your rent, homes.

29
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,691
I don't pay rent, homes.

30
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,762
What's up, man?
You got a problem?

31
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,681
Issue of some kind?

32
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,609
Yeah, I don't like your fucking hat.

33
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,530
You know, I think you kinda
wanted me to have an issue,

34
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,045
so I thought of that one.

35
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,370
I'll see you outside, my friend.

36
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,648
Oh, we all got to go
outside sometime, brother.

37
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,570
This place is just a dream.
You a gambler?

38
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,370
Not like you.

39
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,325
You want to fuck around
or you want to cut cards

40
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,606
for my last $500?

41
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,242
I'll put 10 grand against your $500.

42
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,882
I haven't got 10 grand.
That's an unequal bet.

43
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,169
It's a unequal general situation.

44
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
Well, fuck it. Get a deck.

45
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,206
That's funny, no?

46
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,681
I thought you
wanted my business card.

47
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,530
Congratulations.

48
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,280
I know you.

49
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,851
I think you're the kind of guy
that likes to lose.

50
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,330
Life's a losing proposition, right?
You might as well get it over with.

51
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,726
- Need a stake?
- You like staking losers?

52
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,884
I know how you guys stake people.

53
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,722
Then you know everything.

54
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,684
Your luck is no good tonight.

55
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,125
Oh, that depends,

56
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,047
if you give me
another $10,000 credit.

57
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,887
You came in with $10,000 in cash.

58
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,765
You didn't give it to me.

59
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,890
Well, I mean, this is
a gambling establishment.

60
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,122
Have I ever not paid you?

61
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,927
Eventually a debt
gets too big to pay.

62
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,051
You owe me $240,000

63
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,561
and I want it in seven days.

64
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,961
He took it, man.

65
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,289
Stake me 50 grand.

66
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,844
At 20 points.

67
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,924
Give him 50 grand.

68
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,251
You make sure my man
over here has your digits and so forth.

69
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,251
I feel better about your hat.

70
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,205
This motherfucker.

71
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,327
There's 40. I'm going to
keep back 10, okay?

72
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,290
You know, you can take the whole 50
against my vig,

73
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,886
but this is a gambling establishment.
I came to play.

74
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,323
Just one blue $10,000 marker, please.

75
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,401
No, no.

76
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,080
Don't look at anyone.
You look at me. Just do it.

77
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,285
21.

78
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,163
Another satisfied customer.

79
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,970
Let's play the two.

80
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,164
$20,000?

81
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,244
He doesn't want you to look at him.

82
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,328
Just keep dealing the cards.

83
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,444
$40,000.

84
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,167
I'm good.

85
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,327
Take it.

86
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,171
Player wins.

87
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,244
Don't look at him. There's no limit.

88
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,442
He wants to fuck or fight,
and I'm not interested in either.

89
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,363
So, please, just deal the cards.

90
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,767
- It's for your protection.
- For my protection?

91
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,130
Fuck my protection.
You don't come here

92
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,565
for fucking protection from yourself.

93
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,846
You come for the fucking opposite.

94
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,162
And here I am.
So, please, deal the cards.

95
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,406
Thank you.

96
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,084
$80,000.

97
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,761
Player wins.

98
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,681
No more bets.

99
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,241
You got me feeling lucky.
I'm putting everything on black.

100
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,845
Red's been coming up all night.

101
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,921
You want me to pay you now?

102
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,047
Is that what you want me to do?

103
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,281
- No.
- Why not?

104
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,687
Maybe I enjoy watching the show.

105
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,445
What about ripping me off outside
if I win?

106
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,483
Not in that business, brother.

107
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,971
Everything on black.

108
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,246
No more bets.

109
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,725
Nineteen, red.

110
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,764
Float me some spending money.

111
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,329
That's at 20 points, too.

112
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,964
First public notice that was
ever made of Shakespeare

113
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,641
was from a Grub Street writer,
Robert Greene,

114
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,125
who called him an "upstart crow

115
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,680
"beautified with our feathers,"

116
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,649
in the book...

117
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,004
In the book,
under that title on the board.

118
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,930
Is the beautified feathers thing because

119
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,685
Greene knew that Shakespeare
was the Earl of Oxford?

120
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,611
Absolutely...

121
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,601
Not.

122
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,729
Not even close!

123
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,646
I...

124
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,202
The Earl of Oxford
published poetry, okay?

125
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,361
And it wasn't any good.

126
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,283
I mean, had Oxford been
able to get a play put on,

127
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,811
he'd have broken a leg to do it.

128
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,088
I mean, can you think
of any human being

129
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,884
that would, for any reason,

130
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,962
not put his name on <i>Hamlet?</i>

131
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,124
The Oxfordian thing.
The anti-Stratfordian thing.

132
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,610
What pisses people off
about Shakespeare...

133
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,882
What lies behind every controversy

134
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,969
about Shakespeare

135
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,810
is rage.

136
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,004
Rage over the nature

137
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,523
and unequal distribution of talent.

138
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,122
The rage that genius appears

139
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,164
where it appears
for no material reason at all.

140
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,084
Desiring a thing

141
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,563
cannot make you have it.

142
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,406
Now, the trouble with writing,

143
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,887
if I may bring it up here
in the English Department...

144
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,647
...is we all do a little of it
from time to time, writing.

145
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,810
And some of us start to think,
delusionally,

146
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,645
maybe with a little time,

147
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,484
a little peace, a little money in the bank,

148
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,766
and you get that room of your own,

149
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,444
you think, "Well, shit,

150
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,170
"I might be a writer, too."

151
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,768
I mean, we accept genius in sports

152
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,849
as something we cannot do.

153
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,002
But it's no more likely that
you could be a writer that

154
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,600
you could be what?
An Olympic pole-vaulter?

155
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,530
Because what you have to be

156
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,882
before you try to be a pole-vaulter...

157
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,963
Hello! ls a pole-vaulter, no?

158
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,650
- Yeah!
- You are one.

159
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,689
- A pole-vaulter?
- A novelist.

160
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,643
No, I am not. For me to be a novelist,

161
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,171
I would have to
make a deal with myself,

162
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,288
that it was okay being
a mediocrity in a profession

163
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,249
that died commercially
in the last century.

164
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,568
All right, people do that.
I am not one of them.

165
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,768
If you take away nothing else
from my class,

166
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,843
from this experience, let it be this...

167
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,001
If you're not a genius,
don't bother, all right?

168
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,491
The world needs plenty of electricians,

169
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,164
and a lot of them are happy.

170
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,369
I'll be fucked if I'll be a mid-list
novelist getting good reviews

171
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,482
from the people
I give good reviews to.

172
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,246
Let's have a look at Dexter. Dexter!

173
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,361
An ordinary-looking young man
with a what?

174
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,211
Size 40 jacket, regular features,

175
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,171
and decent dentition,

176
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,561
is the second-ranked
collegiate tennis player

177
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,529
in the United States of America.

178
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,405
How did that come about, Dexter?

179
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,449
You come from a tennis family?

180
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,326
Well, I mean,

181
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,966
I started playing
five years ago in high school

182
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,202
'cause the tennis guys
have the best weed.

183
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,131
After you started tennis,
how long was it

184
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,725
before you were
better than everybody?

185
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,405
Before I was better than everybody,

186
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,567
or before I knew it?

187
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,166
What happened when you noticed

188
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,561
you were naturally
better than everybody?

189
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,686
I...

190
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,644
I got interested in the game.

191
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,929
That is an IQ break point,
brother. Right there!

192
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,327
Do you remember Machiavelli?

193
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,970
That would have been in September.

194
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,766
Man.

195
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,490
I can remember September.

196
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,241
All right.

197
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,523
Is it the game, brother, or the money?

198
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,403
<i>Virtu or fama?</i> Fame or virtue?
What are you after?

199
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,882
Don't go modest on me.
What do you want?

200
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,046
Both.

201
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,010
You got ambitious, yeah?

202
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,926
I realised, as I learned about the game,

203
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,525
that I was in reach of...

204
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,125
In reach of...

205
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,124
In reach of...

206
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,131
Highest level?

207
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,564
Highest level, yeah.

208
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,124
Highest level.

209
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
But it's still a gamble, isn't it?

210
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,125
Look, I'm a literature teacher.

211
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,520
I can't write well enough to bother,

212
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,409
Or I just don't bother, whichever.

213
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,767
Whichever it is, there'll be
no apotheosis around here.

214
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,564
There'll be no <i>"Vae, puto, deus fio!"</i>

215
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,721
around here.

216
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,609
That's what Emperor Vespasian
said on his deathbed,

217
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,047
"Dear me, I think I'm becoming a god."

218
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,840
But do you know who does write
at the highest level?

219
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,769
When most of us and even I...

220
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,566
Even I write barely adequately?

221
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,731
Do you know who it is?

222
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,367
In this room. Who is it?

223
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,880
Don't give me that look.
No, no, no, no, no.

224
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,849
It isn't the one who talks the most.

225
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,366
You're an NPR host, tops.

226
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,607
Okay?

227
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,162
The literary person in here

228
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,044
is Miss Phillips.

229
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,207
She's the least obstreperous
in this room,

230
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,011
the quietest,

231
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,725
and the only one

232
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,000
who can have a real career at letters.

233
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,846
Some of you can have one perceptually.

234
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,362
Only she can have one in reality.

235
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,850
She is better at writing

236
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,129
than our U.S. presently
amateur number two

237
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,326
is at tennis.

238
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,443
Yet she chooses to hide,

239
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,682
or just blend in with the rest of you.

240
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,806
Why?

241
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,209
Why is that, Miss Phillips?

242
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,686
I...

243
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,882
Being in the middle
is the safest place to be.

244
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,565
Where do you come from?

245
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,130
- Ohio.
- Ohio.

246
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,770
Parents are geniuses, by any chance?

247
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,966
Filthy rich?

248
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,041
No.

249
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,003
Well, your dad wasn't
the Earl of Oxford, was he?

250
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,206
No.

251
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,721
No?

252
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,244
How old were you when you read?

253
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,171
I was two.

254
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,681
Two? Well, that's early.
That's prodigious.

255
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,244
Any advantages?
Literary home life?

256
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,410
Who's your father?

257
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,327
Well...

258
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,640
He worked in a factory.

259
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,046
Well, your mother?

260
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,921
I don't...

261
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,081
- What was...
- She was an alcoholic.

262
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,251
She was insane.

263
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,046
Wait, wasn't your dad...

264
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,690
I don't see how this is pertinent.

265
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,446
No money,

266
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,281
no advantages, no peer of the realm.

267
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,928
You're not the Earl of Oxford, are you?

268
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,886
No?

269
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,566
Then why are you better
than the rest of us?

270
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,450
No, you look at me.

271
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,360
You are better than the rest of us.

272
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,209
If no one's told you yet
you're a genius and an artist,

273
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,441
let me be the first.

274
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,040
Okay. I don't know if you can say that.

275
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,844
'Cause I think it's subjective, man.

276
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,282
I mean, we all have something to offer.

277
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,131
Bullshit.

278
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,970
Genius is magical, not material.

279
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,565
If you don't have the magic,

280
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,449
no amount of wishing will make it so.

281
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,567
Miss Phillips,

282
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,529
if you plan to continue
to come to my class,

283
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,200
you sit in the front where you belong

284
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,446
or don't bother showing up.

285
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,205
Have a nice day.

286
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,811
So, I mean, if you
can step in in some way, I...

287
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,326
Dean Fuller?

288
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,481
May I have a word?

289
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
More words?

290
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,324
The athletic department has asked

291
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,925
how a certain person is doing.

292
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,725
You mean the certain person
who cannot stay off his phone?

293
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,288
I mean, you do realise
that this certain person

294
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,407
cannot write at a high school level,

295
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,005
never mind a collegiate one.

296
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,844
That doesn't matter though,
right? I mean, come on.

297
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,286
Half the fucking
tenured faculty would be

298
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,044
flogged to death for idiocy
at ordinary grammar school,

299
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,360
in any previous century, so...

300
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,050
Why would it matter?

301
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,487
Why do you care about that

302
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,608
if you don't care about anything?

303
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,245
You're probably right.

304
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,206
Motherfucker!

305
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,603
I'll never beat you, Mr. Dexter.

306
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,645
But if you ever give me a point again,

307
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,801
I'll fire you.

308
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,920
Good luck in the finals.

309
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,241
Thank you, ma'am.

310
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,361
Why do you need the money?

311
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,040
If you were escaping for a purpose,

312
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,127
maybe I'd buy it.

313
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,408
Well, going on as I am
is the only thing I've got.

314
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,010
That's sophistical.

315
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,961
It's beneath you.

316
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,606
I think you would agree
that modification is possible.

317
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,966
Do you?

318
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,244
I know you're in real trouble.

319
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,085
I know this is all connected
to your grandfather's death.

320
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,842
But you're not narcissistic enough to

321
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,043
put on a show,
nor are you an adolescent.

322
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,970
And I think it goes without saying

323
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,929
that you're far from stupid.

324
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,406
You're my son.

325
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,604
But you have to understand...

326
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,481
...I've said good-bye before
to people I love.

327
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,130
Yeah, whatever did happen to Dad?

328
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,009
I have done it many, many times.

329
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,447
I don't want to know
the nature of your problem.

330
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,847
I just want
you not to have it any more.

331
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,442
I'm not giving you any more.

332
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,201
Hey-

333
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,925
You Jim Bennett?

334
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,809
- Yeah.
- Get in.

335
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,605
Big Ernie.

336
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,770
You're not that big.

337
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,521
I'm not talking about my jacket, brother.

338
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,561
You know, with all due respect,

339
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,280
I'm not interested in your johnson, so...

340
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,731
Sure you are.

341
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,802
It has been so since the Greeks.

342
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,610
I can't argue with that, I guess.

343
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,123
A friend of mine says
that you're a teacher.

344
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,450
I'm associate professor.

345
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,883
The amount of cash
you want is more than

346
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,531
I am ordinarily disposed
to loan out, unless, say,

347
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,648
you're a medium-sized
country with the ability

348
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,326
to raise taxes under
the threat of military force.

349
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,607
Or...

350
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,926
a Eurotrash cokehead

351
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,729
who has a father
that can be squeezed

352
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,611
after the little prick's
micro-budget sci-fi film

353
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,250
doesn't get picked up at Sundance.

354
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,651
Are you following me?

355
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,248
You have family
that can be squeezed?

356
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,480
I'm saying that rhetorically.

357
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,126
Let's just deal with this as gentlemen,
who understand each other, please.

358
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,326
No.

359
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,451
I need for us to treat each other

360
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,601
like we're not gentlemen

361
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,603
and that we're very, very stupid.

362
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,285
Okay. There's no family.
There's never any family.

363
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,647
What do you make?
$100,000, $150,000 a year?

364
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,131
$200,000 before taxes?

365
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,406
What's wrong with you?
You got brain damage?

366
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,042
Some fundamental disability?
$200,000 is a monk!

367
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,725
And you, a monk,

368
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,086
owe that Korean son of a bitch,

369
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,571
that prince of fucking darkness,

370
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,721
that much already.

371
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,009
And then another $50,000,

372
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,969
excluding the vig, to Neville Baraka,

373
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,481
who will kill you,
because when you cut cards

374
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,881
he got the king of spades
and you laughed at him.

375
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,650
You're pretty well informed.

376
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,167
You borrowed 50K
from a very dangerous man

377
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,880
after he was already going to kill you.

378
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,411
Yes, I did.

379
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,689
Birth, education, intelligence, talent,

380
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,046
looks, family money,

381
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,162
has all this been
some real comprehensive

382
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,083
fucking burden for you?

383
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,888
I see two problems.

384
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,844
One, the world at his feet, in this town,

385
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,286
and he's a fucking monk

386
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,368
because, apparently, "Fuck it."

387
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,245
Two, he wants to dance with the devil

388
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,725
for some unspecified reason,

389
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,888
and therefore owes money
to Korean murderers,

390
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,610
and talks about a schvartze's hat

391
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,841
in a place where you can get killed,

392
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,046
and they merely drop your body up

393
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,167
the Angeles Crest.

394
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,321
Three, he wants to borrow

395
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,402
a quarter of a million dollars
to pay off debts,

396
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,648
which he will, in fact,
not pay off because,

397
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,564
to go back to point two, he's suicidal.

398
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,807
Just let me know
what you can do for me, all right?

399
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,563
If I help you consolidate these debts,

400
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,721
even at a lesser load,

401
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,166
do you think that I will be anyone

402
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,924
you want to fuck up the ass?

403
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,881
Am I likelier to be fucked up the ass?

404
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,610
Less likely, I imagine.

405
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,722
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

406
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,605
I'm not your doctor.

407
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,964
I'm not your cognitive therapist.

408
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,451
But let me be your uncle.

409
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,928
You have to pay 10% a week.

410
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,406
I know what I have to do.

411
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,686
Where you going to get my money?

412
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,807
I'll get the money.

413
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,570
How much you want?

414
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,326
I am $260,000 all in.

415
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,965
When's the last time
you had money in your hand

416
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,565
to pay a debt and paid it?

417
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,490
Don't fuck with me.

418
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,167
This will be the first time
when you pay, am I right?

419
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,001
That's right.

420
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,605
We're not done.

421
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,649
I need something from you.

422
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,360
What, collateral?

423
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,766
No.

424
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,124
I need you to tell me,

425
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,448
"I need this money because
I am a scumbag gambler.

426
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,490
"I am a scumbag gambler

427
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,364
"who is drowning in his own shit.

428
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,403
"That's the kind of man I am, Frank.

429
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,122
"And I want you to loan me,
a dying, suicidal asshole,

430
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,611
"a lot of money."

431
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,202
That's too much to
remember. Repeat it.

432
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,364
Well, I'll make it simpler for you.

433
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,010
You want this money, you tell me,

434
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,360
"I am not a man."

435
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,321
Say it.

436
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,282
Say, "I am not a man."

437
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,641
<i>Yes?</i>

438
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,162
Did you mean what you said?

439
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,330
About me having talent?

440
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,520
<i>Is there something you don't get about</i>

441
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,682
<i>"A ++, see me "?</i>

442
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,843
Then you never see me.

443
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,682
<i>Yeah, well, I don't want to see you.</i>

444
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,680
Because I've seen you in your other life?

445
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,841
No.

446
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,850
<i>No, it isn't that.</i>

447
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,883
Do you know
why I'm in trouble here?

448
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,848
Because I tell the truth.
That's what I do.

449
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,967
Do you want me to split the atom,

450
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,566
succumb to velocity,
and tell you the truth?

451
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,361
Physiology doesn't lie.
Everything else does.

452
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,171
Everybody else does.

453
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,890
Physiology doesn't.

454
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,888
It's post-intellectual.

455
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,242
What are you trying to say to me?

456
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm not in any
position to say anything.

457
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,961
Try.

458
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,565
Why should I try?

459
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,085
Because what you said before.

460
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,651
I need you to leave.

461
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,405
Right now. All right,
this is not happening.

462
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm serious. Go. You have to go.

463
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,601
I want you to sign this.

464
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,761
Absolutely fucking not.

465
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,922
I want you to fucking sign it.

466
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,161
Look, I am not being dramatic, okay?

467
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,366
But that was somebody else.

468
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,851
You are being dramatic.

469
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,684
Which is fine, because
the novel's basically okay,

470
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,489
but that's what you are, a dramatist.

471
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,090
Did you write this
because you believed in it,

472
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,282
or because you thought
this is what people wanted?

473
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,440
Well, what do you propose
we move on to?

474
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,484
When was the last time

475
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,887
that somebody told you
that you're a genius?

476
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,044
We're not having this conversation.

477
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,804
I want to go to a restaurant.

478
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,327
There's a whole bunch of things

479
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,807
I don't do any more, and that's...

480
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,805
kind of up there.

481
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,884
Guy with no money speaking.
How may I direct your call?

482
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,244
<i>I'm reading your book.</i>

483
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,241
Not bad.

484
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,481
If you want to get into producing,

485
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,561
there's only about
a hundred grand against it

486
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,687
at Warner Brothers.

487
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320
Good script.
I know the guy who did it.

488
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,324
It's an indie at best.

489
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,561
Yeah.

490
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,331
Yeah. That's what they thought.

491
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,007
I hear you went to Little Frankie
for some money.

492
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,161
He wouldn't loan it to you.

493
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,164
Well, you heard wrong, because
he did try to loan it to me

494
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,765
and I didn't take it.

495
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,844
You didn't like the terms?

496
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,082
No, the terms weren't acceptable.

497
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,930
But you're in to me.

498
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,921
And I ain't Fannie Mae.
Ain't no bailouts.

499
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,242
Oh, yeah, then Why'd you
loan me the money?

500
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,968
A gamble between two players
who like to play.

501
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,606
Me and you.

502
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,365
<i>Double header.</i>

503
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,931
Let me give you a bit of advice here.

504
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,126
<i>What's that?</i>

505
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,931
You owe somebody money,
you don't fuck around.

506
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,763
<i>I want the money by Monday.</i>

507
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,282
<i>I'll take that car of yours.
Consider it collateral.</i>

508
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,689
In The Stranger...

509
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,203
...Camus's protagonist fires five shots.

510
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,005
The sixth shot of the revolver

511
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,164
he is reserving,
symbolically, for himself.

512
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,804
Noticing that, originally,

513
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,804
is why I'm here now.

514
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,801
Lamar.

515
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,721
Lamar.

516
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,882
You're taking notes or you're texting?

517
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,322
You have anything you want to add?

518
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,891
What do you think?

519
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,369
Maybe the dude had a hammer

520
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,528
on an empty chamber or something,

521
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,041
or a weird French piece
that only took five.

522
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,491
No, my idea works better
if he has a full six.

523
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,685
I don't understand suicide.

524
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,604
Well, that's because you're happy.

525
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,002
You got a BMW M1.
How you unhappy?

526
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,811
Do I look happy?

527
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,806
I'm not happy.

528
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,491
You know why?

529
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,841
Because I'm teaching the Modern Novel

530
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,687
to a classroom full of students

531
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,881
who don't give a fuck.

532
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,527
You know,

533
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,881
you really should have gone
for American Realism.

534
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,042
I mean, let's have more fucking realism.

535
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,168
I mean, shouldn't I be
teaching you things?

536
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,768
Nah, I should.
I know all you're here for

537
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,609
is a sufficiency of English credits,

538
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,285
but, Jesus, if I'm here,

539
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,209
I ought to be doing better. Right?

540
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,562
I could stand here stark naked...

541
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,242
...and I could yell as loud as I want,

542
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,289
and nobody cares.

543
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,560
When you leave here today,
call your parents,

544
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,647
and tell them you apologise
for wasting their time,

545
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,245
and more importantly,
wasting their money,

546
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,204
sitting in this classroom,
learning absolutely nothing.

547
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,167
Let's start fresh.

548
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,004
Let's clean the slate right now.

549
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,923
Let me introduce myself.

550
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,725
My name is James Bennett.

551
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,890
I'm here pretending to teach.

552
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,443
And you've been here
pretending to learn.

553
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,245
This is what I want you to do.
Write down

554
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,605
that he saves the sixth shot
symbolically for himself.

555
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,209
You're not going to find
a reference anywhere, okay?

556
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,440
Because I am the only one
who thought of it, all right?

557
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,720
It's in a monograph somewhere

558
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,240
that got me into this situation...

559
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,284
Where I can't,
so I pretend to teach!

560
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,641
And you pretend to learn.

561
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,571
Lamar!
The fucking phone!

562
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,169
You stay after.
Everybody else, just go.

563
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,961
Go.

564
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,446
Go!

565
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,650
I guess, we should go.

566
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,846
Coming?

567
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,485
What do I have to do?

568
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,890
What do I do? Get ten guys,

569
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,405
some weapons, take out
a life insurance policy,

570
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,641
and try to put that phone up your ass?

571
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,761
Because I will.

572
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,444
I need you to pay attention!

573
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,362
Is that too much to ask for?

574
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,687
You come into this class

575
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,643
and you pay attention
for a fucking hour?

576
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,005
You know, they expect me
to pass you, regardless.

577
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,926
Regardless! They want me
to give you a passing grade,

578
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,126
so you can keep going out there

579
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,690
and bouncing that basketball around.

580
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,161
I need you to put the phone down
for a second.

581
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,964
You're not the
only one losing his shit!

582
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,162
I was going to talk to you anyway.

583
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,722
Because I can't talk
to anybody over there.

584
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,849
'Cause all they going to say
is what keeps me in line

585
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,080
for what they want me to be.

586
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,488
Which is "Lamar,"
but I don't want to be "Lamar."

587
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,841
I done all that.

588
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,851
I just want to be another
fucking dude in the universe,

589
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,760
or do more than just being "Lamar."

590
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,330
Yeah, I know all about it.

591
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,084
But the fucking coach
don't know about it.

592
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,044
There's more than being "Lamar."

593
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,650
I stick with this shit, man,
I'll go out of my mind!

594
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,881
Probably be one of those brothers

595
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,120
that talks to himself in,
like, third person and shit.

596
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,170
Talk about how, "Lamar is
at ease with his celebrity."

597
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,687
They got me in a box
where they want me.

598
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,169
Trapped by talent, imagine that.

599
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,085
You know, man, in here it's all

600
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,283
existential situations and shit.

601
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,362
No matter what
you start talking about,

602
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,722
you come around
to be free or not to be free.

603
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,042
How to be yourself or nothing at all.

604
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,406
Is that what I talk about?
All or nothing?

605
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,320
I've never heard you
talk about anything else

606
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,566
but to be or not to be.

607
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,723
And I've had four classes with you.

608
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,245
Maybe you got me.

609
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,565
I need to go pro.

610
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,881
I don't think you're going to
have any trouble, Lamar.

611
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,924
I don't mean later.
I mean now. I need to go pro.

612
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,410
I already got a knee.

613
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,762
Nobody knows about it,
'cause I don't say anything.

614
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,046
But I already got a knee.

615
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,603
See, I'm not going to
sit here and tell you

616
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,364
that my mom needs an operation,

617
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,249
or my little sister has spina bifida.

618
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,001
But I am going to tell you
that I got a knee.

619
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,560
I got a knee. I'm a junior.

620
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,809
And whenever I tell somebody
I don't wanna play college ball

621
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,730
in my senior year, nobody listens to me.

622
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,930
It's like I'm talking Chinese
on another fucking planet!

623
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,081
And then the coach tells me

624
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,491
I don't have the market value
I would have

625
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,170
if I don't play out my senior year.

626
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,281
But what he doesn't know
is I got a fucking knee.

627
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,962
You have it looked at
away from the department?

628
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,001
Yeah.

629
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,926
<i>Yeah, that's right. All right,</i>

630
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,809
<i>here's Allen bringing it up
the court on a fast break.</i>

631
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,923
<i>Moves to the top of the key.</i>

632
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,320
<i>Lamar drives.</i>

633
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,490
<i>Throws it down, and he's fouled! Yes!</i>

634
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,326
<i>Allen at the line
to complete the three-point play.</i>

635
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,730
<i>After what's happened in
the last two and a half minutes,</i>

636
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,849
<i>there is no way Lamar
is missing this free throw.</i>

637
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,442
<i>And swish. His eyes on the prize.</i>

638
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,284
<i>Oh, here's Fisher inbounding the ball.</i>

639
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,169
<i>Wildcats bringing
the full court pressure.</i>

640
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,560
<i>Martin bringing it up the court.</i>

641
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,680
<i>Three seconds on the clock.</i>

642
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,847
<i>Passes cross court.</i>

643
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,247
<i>Allen, from out of nowhere, tips it!</i>

644
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,846
<i>This one is over! Wildcats have done it!</i>

645
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,008
<i>Oh, my, oh, my!</i>

646
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,809
<i>Lamar Allen, one of the best
basketball players in the game.</i>

647
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,691
<i>All season long, he produced
at a high calibre of play...</i>

648
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,850
Did you have money on the game?

649
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,363
Why would I have money on the game?

650
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,887
He's a student of mine.
That's unethical, all right?

651
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,644
I would not bet on a student of mine.

652
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,320
You think I would do
something like that?

653
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,681
I would never
do anything like that, okay?

654
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,487
What kind of a person
do you think I am?

655
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,365
Do I have money on the game!

656
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,845
Is he good at English?

657
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,565
No, he's not!

658
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,643
Fucking doing in my fucking house.

659
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,881
Fuck!

660
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,042
How bad is this trouble you're in?

661
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,001
I'm always in trouble.

662
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,206
No, I mean,

663
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,684
do you still need money?

664
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,603
- No.
- Truthfully?

665
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,081
Truthfully.

666
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,521
I never know
when to believe you any more.

667
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,329
Perhaps I should believe the gangster

668
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,243
who phoned my home.

669
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,931
What's that?

670
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,081
What I owe.

671
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,566
Jesus. How is this possible?

672
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,290
Same as your marriage. I lost.

673
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,361
No.

674
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,124
Marriage is in the real world.

675
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,243
It's not a game of chance.

676
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,890
Now you're talking crazy.

677
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,282
What'll they do to you if you don't pay?

678
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,602
Break every bone in my body.

679
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,966
Go after the family.

680
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,570
I can't help doing this.

681
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,122
I don't believe this is a disease.

682
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,840
Well, I just had a considerable
conversation about character.

683
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,201
And there's going to be a moment
when I want something again,

684
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,726
when I won't allow myself
to be seen in this condition.

685
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,802
But it's not now,
and it's not up to you

686
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,491
or anything you or anybody
else fucking says, okay?

687
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,802
Are you degraded enough
to come with your mother to the bank?

688
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,930
In cases like this I have to ask,

689
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,331
is everything okay?

690
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,410
Nothing's okay,

691
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,320
when someone needs
that amount of money in cash.

692
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,246
But it's my money,

693
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,880
and it's none of your goddamn business.

694
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,481
Are you a relation?

695
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,650
This is my son.

696
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,082
Either you can't see
the uncanny resemblance,

697
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,850
or you're implying
she's under duress or something.

698
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,207
Should I be?

699
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,441
Look, dean

700
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,286
it's my money and there's plenty of it.

701
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,610
And don't even start to tell me

702
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,887
that all of this bullshit
is for my protection,

703
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,325
because that is understood.

704
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,887
Now, you have the withdrawal slip.

705
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,691
Here is my I.D.

706
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,970
There are sufficient funds.

707
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,202
My family has been with this bank

708
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,727
since my father-in-law started it.

709
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,806
Now, what I want

710
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,201
is $260,000..

711
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,561
...in cash.

712
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,890
Are you sure you want that in cash?

713
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,564
Cash. Okay? Cash.

714
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,241
I'm sorry, I'm going to ask for...

715
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,321
What?

716
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,402
For a second piece of identification.

717
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,244
It's for your own protection.

718
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,165
<i>This is the last of it.</i>

719
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,091
If I ever have to hear
about your problems again,

720
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,766
I will never see you again.
Do you understand that?

721
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,080
I need you to fucking understand that!

722
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,525
Am I embarrassing you?

723
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,603
Do you want to just take the money?

724
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,207
You want to just take
the money and go?

725
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,289
Even if I say goodbye

726
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,244
and consider it cheap to be rid of you?

727
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,091
Yeah, I want to take the money and go.

728
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,326
Hey-

729
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,887
Hey-

730
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,327
If I have to pull you into an inappropriate
relationship to get you out of your job,

731
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,890
I'm ready to go.

732
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,400
So am I.

733
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,168
What if I told you
that I'm not a gambler?

734
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,844
What if you saw me
with a needle in my arm

735
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,922
and I told you that I'm not a junkie?

736
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,000
I saw you be a professor

737
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,570
and I know you're not one of those.

738
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,125
Yeah.

739
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,125
It's good to come out here. It's good.

740
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,962
I come out here because
it makes me feel alive.

741
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,127
No.

742
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,407
No. No. Not good enough.

743
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,369
There's something else,
I don't quite know what it is.

744
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,284
I know a lot,
but I don't fucking know that.

745
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,809
"And I always sat on a blanket
in the middle of nowhere

746
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,082
"with nothing around me
but infinite possibilities,"

747
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,646
and it's bullshit. I'm sick of it. So...

748
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,325
You are the perfect example

749
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,643
of how a person can start off
with no problems whatsoever,

750
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,046
and then go out of their way

751
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,760
to make sure that
they have all of them.

752
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,564
There's no relative degree of suffering.

753
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,360
What, you want me to
talk about my problems?

754
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,721
Well, I don't like people with problems

755
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,007
or the fucking vanity to bring them up.

756
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,924
That's where I'm from.

757
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,649
I'm like my mother.

758
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,242
You know, whether I'm like my father
or not I couldn't tell you,

759
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,080
because she got rid of him
when I was little.

760
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,244
And you don't think that
you need to talk to anybody?

761
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,007
No.

762
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,004
I need a lot of things.

763
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,810
I need to wipe myself out first.

764
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,842
I need to have no past. If I can get to
nothing, then I can start over.

765
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,770
Hello!

766
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,046
Echo!

767
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,964
Do you want to help me start over?

768
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,322
There is something wrong
with everybody here.

769
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,640
They should be in the hospital.

770
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,801
Yeah, that's right, but they're not.

771
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,405
All right, the Man wants you
to be in the hospital.

772
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,005
These people are fucking Americans

773
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,570
taking a major stand for freedom.

774
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,563
Well, assisted autonomy.

775
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,330
This is the inside of my soul, kid.

776
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,765
This is what I got.

777
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,921
Wow.

778
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,402
Well, at least
I'm going to get rid of my mother.

779
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,687
This table right here. Come on.

780
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,330
Buy-in at $10,000.

781
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,446
How far you going, man?

782
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,364
As far as it goes, buddy.

783
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,840
I go as far as that seat
on the other side of you, man.

784
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,443
Save it for the old lady, cowboy.

785
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,601
That's $500, sir.

786
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,451
Yes, it is. Are you a dealer
or an investment counsellor?

787
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,806
Double.

788
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,371
We gambling or what?

789
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,646
Let's go. Give me the three.

790
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,881
Is he kidding?

791
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,961
Whoa.

792
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,800
What are you, Houdini?

793
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,884
Pulled that one out of your ass.

794
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,807
Wow.

795
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,967
Unbelievable.

796
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,562
Pulls a three on an eight.

797
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,810
Unbelievable.

798
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,721
I'm sorry.

799
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,524
I'll play another $10,000.

800
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,485
Buy-in at $10,000!

801
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,530
Give me the bag.

802
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,721
That's $500, sir.

803
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,166
It's not $500.

804
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,211
$1,000.

805
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,725
Another $500.

806
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,561
It's $2,000.

807
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,801
Deal the cards, please.

808
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,245
$2,000 plays.

809
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,891
Buy-in at $10,000!

810
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,928
<i>Buy-in at $10,000!</i>

811
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,930
<i>Buy-in at $10,000!</i>

812
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,801
Everything?

813
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,322
You want to hear something
really fucking crazy?

814
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,364
There was a student, just the other day,

815
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,681
who said that my problem,

816
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,165
if one's nature is a problem

817
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,851
rather than just
fucking problematic, right,

818
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,928
is that I see things
in terms of victory or death,

819
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,321
and not just victory but total victory.

820
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,205
It's true.

821
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,681
I always have.

822
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,683
Well, it's either victory or don't bother.

823
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,763
The only thing worth doing
is the impossible, right?

824
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,649
Everything else is fucking grey.

825
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,604
You're born as a man
with the nerves of a soldier,

826
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,682
the apprehension
of an angel, to lift a phrase,

827
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,126
but there's no fucking use for it.

828
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,362
Here? Where's the use for it?

829
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,360
What, you're set to be a philosopher

830
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,811
or a king or fucking Shakespeare,

831
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,882
and this is all they give you? This?

832
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,041
What? 20-odd years of school,

833
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,451
which is all instruction
in how to be ordinary.

834
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,881
They'll fucking kill you,
and they fucking will!

835
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,286
You know, and then it's a career, right?

836
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,045
Which is just not the same thing
as existence, so...

837
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,410
I want unlimited things.
I want everything.

838
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,727
I want a real fucking love,
a real fucking house,

839
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,808
a real fucking thing to do every day,

840
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,166
and, I just...

841
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,367
I'd just rather die if I don't get it.

842
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,164
Did I just say that out loud?

843
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,966
Hey. Jim!

844
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,361
You stopped answering your phone.

845
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,804
I told you the time frame.

846
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,764
What the fuck do I care
about your time frame?

847
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,881
So you don't die.

848
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,450
Everybody dies.

849
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,726
Aren't you afraid of dying from
something other than natural causes?

850
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,080
I got to take whatever's coming,

851
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,360
because I don't have the money.

852
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,562
Your grandfather pops,
and you don't have any money?

853
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,484
Well, my grandfather thought
it was a character builder. So...

854
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,971
Not even, "I'll have it"?

855
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,164
You just say no.

856
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,444
You give the Korean any of his?

857
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,241
No.

858
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,331
You know Lamar Allen?

859
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,561
No.

860
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,808
Don't fuck with me!

861
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,331
He's a student of mine.

862
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,444
And what's this
got to do with anything?

863
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,841
You know what this got
to do with everything!

864
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,525
How much you know Lamar?

865
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,883
<i>Hey, Jim, pick up.</i>

866
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,961
<i>Jim!</i>

867
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,002
<i>I called that number for Lamar
and it wasn't the number.</i>

868
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,168
<i>Now, Jim, I need Lamar.</i>

869
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,803
<i>And I know where you live.</i>

870
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,041
<i>Tick-took, motherfucker.</i>

871
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,130
Human weakness is not
something I discourage.

872
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,091
How could I?

873
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,201
I run gambling establishments.

874
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,125
I loan money.

875
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,246
I've not been in debt
for many years, but,

876
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,125
I still remember the feeling.

877
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,201
What's that?

878
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,248
To be obligated.

879
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,122
Unbalanced in one's thoughts.

880
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,642
Insecure, unclean.

881
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,042
I think you want to hurt yourself,

882
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,163
but make others do it for you.

883
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,805
I'm not going to tell you
I'll get the money, all right?

884
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,571
Because I don't know if I can,
and I wouldn't insult you.

885
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,250
It doesn't make any difference.

886
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,482
I mean, I have no position, right?

887
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,847
You expected your money
and I don't have it.

888
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,282
Here we are.
What the fuck do you want to do?

889
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,170
How am I to collect?

890
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,685
Loan me another $100,000.

891
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,842
It's how I got in.
It's the only way I'll get out.

892
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,368
<i>One Mississippi,</i>

893
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,210
<i>two Mississippi,</i>

894
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,884
<i>three Mississippi,</i>

895
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,164
<i>four Mississippi,</i>

896
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,450
<i>five Mississippi...</i>

897
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,571
Fuck!

898
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,570
It's not so bad.

899
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,685
Not so bad.

900
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,203
Perfectly good watch.
Why do you want to sell it?

901
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,330
Well, either I don't need
to know what time it is

902
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,845
or I need money. What do you care?

903
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,081
Well, I need to know if it is...

904
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,600
No, what you need to do
is just come up with an offer or not.

905
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,331
We have so many of these here.

906
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,925
Look, it's an Omega.

907
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,604
It's worth more than $6,000 brand new,

908
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,767
and when you have it

909
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,530
no one'll know that it isn't brand new.

910
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,761
You are insulting me. Why?

911
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,769
- I'm insulting you?
- Why are you insulting me?

912
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,524
- We're not gonna fuck around.
- We're doing business.

913
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,204
No, no. Don't even talk to me any more.

914
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,681
I want you to understand
when I say what I want for it,

915
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,364
I am giving you the figure
that I will take for it.

916
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,441
Do you understand me?

917
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,607
No, no, no. Look at me!

918
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,842
I will say the price now
and you will either say yes or no.

919
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,121
Do you understand?

920
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,366
It is impossible.
Impossible to say yes or...

921
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,441
All right.

922
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,210
Wait. Wait, wait.

923
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,807
It is a good watch.
I am good man, you are good man.

924
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,723
No. I told you, not to say
anything but yes or no.

925
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,881
You're wasting my time!

926
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,645
I am willing to
listening to your price. Okay?

927
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,201
You can't counter it.

928
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,282
When I say my figure,
that's the figure,

929
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,488
and you either say yes or no.
You got it?

930
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,122
How can I say yes or no
if I am not hearing the price?

931
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,050
You're not getting it.

932
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,406
- I am getting it.
- You're not getting it.

933
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,561
- I am getting it.
- No, no, no.

934
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,051
- You're not getting it.
- I am getting it!

935
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,889
You need to understand fully
that what I say

936
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,041
is not an opening figure.

937
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,491
You can say yes or no.

938
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,886
You cannot say a lower figure,

939
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,803
and expect to meet me
at some point in the middle.

940
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,649
Do you under-fucking-stand?

941
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,929
Please. Please.
We are amour, yes? Amour.

942
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,651
Okay? Calm. Calm. Yes?

943
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,923
I understand. What is your price?

944
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,482
$3,500.

945
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,686
$1,000.

946
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,960
- $1,200.
- Go fuck yourself.

947
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,081
I don't give a shit!

948
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,845
No need for this!
What? Where are you going?

949
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,287
What are you doing?
Wait one second!

950
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,249
Please, please, I can't help myself.

951
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,010
Yes, you can. Try.

952
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,131
$2,000?

953
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,285
What? It is good price!

954
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,125
And I'll give you cheque! ls no problem!

955
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,485
- Get in.
- All right.

956
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,368
Jim!

957
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,724
Man, you gave me
the wrong number on Lamar.

958
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,685
You know what else I know?

959
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,481
What's that?

960
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,081
You think all Koreans
are Korean and shit.

961
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,084
And they don't communicate
with the American negro!

962
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,685
I heard you asked Mister Lee to
stake you out of your situation.

963
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,490
And to give you enough
to have a shot at the title

964
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,080
of being the world's stupidest asshole!

965
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,170
Give me Mister Lee's money.

966
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,607
- He didn't front me any.
- Yeah, fuck you.

967
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,563
Well, your information is wrong.

968
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,762
How am I gonna get my money, Jim?

969
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,320
What if I told you I quit my job
and I'm gonna write a novel?

970
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,926
Really?

971
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,771
What did the first one make?

972
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,929
With the advance and royalties,
$17,000 all in.

973
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,285
Fuck me. For one of
the better reviewed first novels of 2007?

974
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,850
I think I'll make other arrangements.

975
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,769
I mean, the culture apparently did.

976
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,400
So let's talk cash first,
other business later.

977
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,800
What about your family?

978
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,447
I got all I could get.

979
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,530
Can I get the money from them
if I send you to Mexico?

980
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,965
You know, "Oh, my God,

981
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,286
"I don't know what happened to him!"

982
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,442
Get my friend Valerio
to mail them your dick.

983
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,440
My family didn't make their money
because they pay up easily.

984
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,085
Apparently that's genetic.

985
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,802
I'll tell you, boy, genetics,

986
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,809
cruel motherfucking mistress.

987
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,042
What if I lit a cigar and
put it out in your eyeball?

988
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,321
Would you give me the money then?

989
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,970
Do I look like a magician?

990
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,482
You must've thought
you was magic occasionally,

991
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,563
or else you wouldn't be in
the African Membership Club

992
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,005
owing me 60 grand.

993
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,962
I'm gonna need the equity
on your house, Jim.

994
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,085
We'll paper it right as a sale.

995
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,004
But then I got to take over
the goddamn mortgage,

996
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,004
find some fucking vice president
of animation to rent it to...

997
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,401
And I don't fucking wanna do that shit!

998
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,246
But you got to make the turnip bleed

999
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,720
from whatever hole it's got, right?

1000
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,607
Now, your grandfather, I respect him,

1001
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,091
he's a businessman.

1002
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,364
But Lamar, who you gave me
the wrong number for...

1003
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,521
Lamar's a good kid, all right.

1004
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,931
He doesn't need any of this shit.

1005
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,009
You gonna tell me you made
a mistake with the number?

1006
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,361
Why would I tell you I made a mistake?

1007
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,209
I gave you a fake one.
I made it up.

1008
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,687
Okay.

1009
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,529
Well, see, my man Mr. Jones
here is going to give you

1010
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,045
the real one.

1011
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,523
That is the last time
that you lie to me, my friend.

1012
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,880
Lamar don't need your help.

1013
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,048
Every man's got to go it alone, Jim.

1014
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,889
And Lamar's got to
make his own choices.

1015
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,843
So let him make it.

1016
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,523
Now, I'm not gonna call him.

1017
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,887
That would merely confuse the issue.

1018
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,044
But you're gonna get me Lamar.

1019
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,881
And it will be more
than an introduction.

1020
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,202
In fact, I don't
even want an introduction.

1021
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,007
Lamar's going to do exactly
what I want him to do

1022
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,321
without ever seeing my face.

1023
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,085
I need him before the game
tomorrow at home.

1024
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,483
Now, they're running
eight points on Michigan.

1025
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,324
You tell Lamar he can win if he wants,

1026
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,164
but no more than seven.

1027
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,403
But you get him for tomorrow.
Because if not,

1028
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,611
I'm going to kill that
pretty little blonde girl,

1029
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,001
show you the pictures,
and then kill you next.

1030
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,770
Hey, what's happening, man?

1031
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,287
Man, making it do what it do.

1032
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,249
Yes, sir!

1033
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,930
No doubt.

1034
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,964
What happened to your face?

1035
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,730
Whatever happened,
it already happened

1036
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,926
and won't happen again.

1037
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,569
So you're starting
to make promises now?

1038
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,449
No, that's not happening.

1039
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,491
You don't get it.

1040
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,810
What's going on?

1041
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,490
I'm getting out of here as fast as I can

1042
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,641
as everybody and their fucking aunt

1043
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,761
is eyeballing me right now.

1044
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,921
It might be better
if you weren't chasing along

1045
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,286
as if you're my wife!

1046
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,487
Jesus Christ.

1047
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,800
I tell the truth, all right.

1048
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,966
- That's all I got.
- No.

1049
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,446
No!

1050
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,160
You can't talk to people like that.

1051
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,685
Really? Who says?

1052
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,843
Who says?

1053
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,971
I do.

1054
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,844
I want you to stop
looking concerned, okay?

1055
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,684
And I want you to shake my hand.

1056
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,524
And you know the kind
of fucking man I am.

1057
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,005
Don't lie to yourself. I don't.

1058
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,126
What happened?

1059
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,440
Nothing happened.

1060
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,527
You're not getting it, okay? Just...

1061
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,961
If I come to your door,
then I'll have made it,

1062
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,201
and everything
will start to be all right.

1063
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,691
If I don't,
then I didn't fucking make it!

1064
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,491
And what you do with the dead
is bury them, that's it!

1065
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,281
You really hate yourself that much?

1066
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,522
Hold out your hand
and say goodbye.

1067
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,326
Please.

1068
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,567
Please?

1069
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,810
It's really fucking easy
to be passionate about

1070
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,531
Robert fucking Greene!

1071
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,608
One, two, three, four.

1072
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,564
What happened to your face, man?

1073
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,883
A little while ago
you came to me for advice

1074
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,804
about turning pro.
I know it's about your knee.

1075
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,644
I know you have a feeling
you have to put money in the bank.

1076
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,801
So...

1077
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,126
I was wondering if you'd like
to make $150,000 in two hours.

1078
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,762
Depends on what you have in mind.

1079
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,645
Throwing a game.

1080
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,565
You can't win tomorrow
by more than seven points.

1081
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,166
That's not throwing a game.

1082
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,244
That's winning by less than eight.

1083
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,810
Who wants me to do it?

1084
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,811
What they got on you?

1085
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,571
Doesn't matter.

1086
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,163
Man, they fucked you up.

1087
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,522
But they ain't need to fuck you up.

1088
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,330
No, I needed it.

1089
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,931
And they'll fuck you up
if you need it, too.

1090
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,445
You gotta deliver.

1091
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,524
I'm asking because I know you need it.

1092
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,840
It's up to you.
It's your call.

1093
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,282
I do this, I get you out of trouble?

1094
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,606
No.

1095
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,367
Hey.

1096
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,881
Where did a teacher like you
get that kind of money?

1097
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,207
<i>He's not there yet,</i>

1098
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,481
<i>Percussion's in front,</i>

1099
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,881
<i>but Kaleidoscopio continues to gain.</i>

1100
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,203
<i>Percussion...
Here comes Kaleidoscopio!</i>

1101
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,210
<i>And he did it! No one can believe it!</i>

1102
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,806
Well, they fucking weren't
supposed to, were they?

1103
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,530
That was the point.

1104
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,046
Sit down.

1105
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,560
You drink?
I don't remember if you drink.

1106
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,087
Of course, there's drink, and drink.

1107
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,924
I drink. But I haven't been drunk

1108
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,923
since Reagan was president.

1109
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,650
I got a DUI, and in jail

1110
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,081
I actually fell down and pissed my pants.

1111
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,243
You don't need to do that twice.

1112
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,891
I tell you this so you'll know
everybody's been there.

1113
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,241
Everybody's been there.

1114
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,401
Once.

1115
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,760
If you're there twice,

1116
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,081
having been there once, I can't help you.

1117
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,841
You know,

1118
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,402
I listen to the drunks

1119
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,608
and it's like
you're listening to a fairy story

1120
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,404
about a fight with a fucking monster

1121
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,210
when the actual title of the story is

1122
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,521
"I Can't Handle My Liquor"
by Mr. Crybaby.

1123
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,601
- Amen.
- I don't know,

1124
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,881
maybe they got a problem,

1125
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,684
but fuck 'em if they do, 'cause I don't.

1126
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,125
Which leads me to ask,

1127
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,284
are you pulling this shit
just now, or forever?

1128
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,206
I mean, do you have a problem,

1129
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,284
"Waah-waah-waah,"
like some little fucking girl, or

1130
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,204
some Somali who can't process that

1131
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,123
there's no food where they live?

1132
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,283
Or are you just fucked up temporarily

1133
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,562
'cause you're temporarily
fucking stupid?

1134
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,963
Are you long business
or short business?

1135
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:37,405
What's the difference?

1136
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,210
I need to know
if you got the fucking brains

1137
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,884
to walk when it's time to walk.

1138
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,485
People don't, you know.

1139
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,642
Ballplayers who can't play any more.

1140
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,131
Assholes trying to maintain

1141
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,487
a standard of living
not possible any more...

1142
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,324
A lot of those around.

1143
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,646
I've seen you be
half a million dollars up.

1144
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,642
I've been up
two and a half million dollars.

1145
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,166
What do you got on you?

1146
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,006
Nothing.

1147
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,441
What did you put away?

1148
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,721
Nothing.

1149
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,922
You get up
two and a half million dollars,

1150
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,241
any asshole in the world
knows what to do.

1151
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,482
You get a house with a 25-year roof,

1152
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,927
an indestructible Jap economy shitbox,

1153
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,605
you put the rest into the system

1154
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,250
at 3%-to-5% to pay your taxes,

1155
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,765
and that's your base, get me?

1156
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,002
That's your
Fortress of Fucking Solitude.

1157
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,924
That puts you for the rest of your life

1158
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,287
at a level of "fuck you."

1159
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,841
Somebody wants you to
do something? "Fuck you."

1160
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,207
Boss pisses you off? "Fuck you!"

1161
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,443
Own your house,
have a couple bucks in the bank,

1162
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,601
don't drink.

1163
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,684
That's all I have to say to
anybody at any social level.

1164
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,604
Did your grandfather take risks?

1165
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,281
Yes.

1166
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,045
I guarantee he did it
from a position of fuck you.

1167
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,044
A wise man's life
is based around fuck you.

1168
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,050
The United States of America
is based on fuck you.

1169
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,806
You're a king?
You have an army?

1170
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,564
Greatest navy in the history
of the world?

1171
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,804
"Fuck you, blow me!
We'll fuck it up ourselves."

1172
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,804
Which we have done.

1173
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,963
Beautiful "fuck you" position lost forever.

1174
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,044
King George lll looks like
a fucking birthday present.

1175
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,047
This is the grandson of
the 17th richest man in California.

1176
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,407
Does he drink?

1177
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,084
What he wants is money.

1178
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,168
Because he doesn't know
when to say, "That's it,

1179
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,242
"I'm two million ahead.
Fuck it. Fuck you.

1180
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,727
"I have a car and a house and a family,

1181
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,201
"and it's all paid for, fuck you."

1182
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,209
I mean, even I did that.

1183
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,570
Of course, it's out by Pearblossom.

1184
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,007
I'll have a beer, just like
anybody else, thank you.

1185
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,924
- What kind?
- Any kind.

1186
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,481
We got 37 beers.
Don't fucking put it on me.

1187
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,525
But he did put it on you, miss!

1188
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,609
You still owe large
two places you shouldn't.

1189
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,363
Why do you want door number three?

1190
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,920
How else do I get out?

1191
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,525
Time payments.
Sell your sperm.

1192
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,921
Sell your ass.
How the fuck should I know?

1193
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,764
I am of the universe,
and you know what it's worth.

1194
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,445
It's worth plenty.

1195
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,961
If I give you this money

1196
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,567
and you don't pay me back,
there are no rules.

1197
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,083
You never get to say
fuck you to anybody ever.

1198
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,404
You will get me not just what
you owe me from your family,

1199
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,880
you will get me their accounts

1200
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,962
so I can have them
vacuumed from Russia.

1201
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,202
You jump off a bridge,
you can do it knowing

1202
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,647
I will kill your entire bloodline.

1203
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,200
Do you understand
the gravity of your situation?

1204
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,810
I understand.

1205
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,888
You get up, you get out.

1206
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,167
$260,000 as requested.

1207
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,441
What's this?

1208
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,762
This much money, what's a car?

1209
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,642
What do you want to
be able to say to me?

1210
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,925
Fuck you.

1211
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,404
You have my money?

1212
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,643
I don't have any money.

1213
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,403
I want you to stake me.

1214
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,202
Stake me, and I'll get your money.

1215
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,766
Why did you see Frank?

1216
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,326
I didn't.

1217
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,331
Now fucking stake me.

1218
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,924
Please, tell me you hit your wife

1219
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,008
harder than that, you fucking pussy.

1220
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,451
You got to give me
$150-fucking-thousand.

1221
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,410
What can I do with you?

1222
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,805
Stake me.

1223
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,130
Fucking stake me!

1224
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,082
Hey, Lamar, let's go, come on!

1225
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,605
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1226
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,287
<i>welcome to tonight's
semi-final conference game!</i>

1227
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,685
<i>Put your hands together for your</i>

1228
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,162
<i>Wildcats!</i>

1229
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,966
The Wildcats come into tonight's game
favourites against the Bulldogs,

1230
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,691
<i>of course, led by
All-American Lamar Allen.</i>

1231
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,885
Let's go, Wildcats, let's go!

1232
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,891
<i>And as we know, as goes
the play of Lamar Allen</i>

1233
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,166
<i>goes the play of the Wildcats.</i>

1234
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,209
<i>You're talking first team All-American.</i>

1235
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,567
<i>That's the kind of season
Lamar Allen has had.</i>

1236
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,202
<i>I expect big things
from this young man tonight.</i>

1237
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,007
Let's jump on 'em hard
in the first five minutes!

1238
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,404
Defence, let's smother 'em.
No second chances, okay?

1239
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,130
Let's go, "Wildcats" on three.
One, two, three.

1240
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,361
Wildcats!

1241
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,642
<i>Revenge on the minds and</i>

1242
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,723
<i>tonight the Wildcats looking to show</i>

1243
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,490
<i>the dominance they've had
all season long</i>

1244
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,891
<i>led by that man right there.</i>

1245
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,331
That's my boy. Yeah, Lamar!

1246
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,084
- That's your boy?
- That's money, baby!

1247
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,321
- That's the kid?
- That's the kid

1248
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,600
I'm talking about right there.

1249
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,405
He knows what he got to do.
The kid is nice!

1250
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,086
The kid is nice!
The kid is nice!

1251
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,049
All right. All right now. All right.

1252
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,362
<i>Lamar Allen with a left-handed slam!</i>

1253
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,726
<i>Gets to the basket, throws it down.</i>

1254
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,524
<i>Cats looking
to make something out of this.</i>

1255
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,965
<i>He's got Lamar Allen.
Turnaround jumper.</i>

1256
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,286
<i>Yes, he's got it!</i>

1257
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,522
<i>Lamar Allen
throwing down the nasty jam!</i>

1258
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,886
<i>Here comes Allen taking it</i>

1259
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,041
<i>up the court on his own.</i>

1260
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,122
<i>Throwing it down with
a left-handed slam!</i>

1261
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,360
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
This shit ain't right.

1262
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,283
<i>Does well in terms of
looking for his shot.</i>

1263
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,284
<i>Lamar Allen throwing down a dunk!</i>

1264
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,210
What is he doing?

1265
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,964
<i>Right now the Wildcats
are in control of this game.</i>

1266
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,725
<i>There's Allen driving down
the left-hand side,</i>

1267
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,881
<i>and he's got it.</i>

1268
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,644
<i>A little kiss off the glass...</i>

1269
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,928
Man, he better start performing
and less scoring.

1270
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,082
I don't get it.
Ain't that your man?

1271
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,806
Yeah, if he don't handle his business,
I'm a handle him.

1272
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,564
<i>Here's the Wildcats from the other end,</i>

1273
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,086
<i>Lamar Allen from about 16 feet!
That's not gonna go.</i>

1274
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,484
Yeah, that's better. That's better.

1275
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,004
Come on! Move your ass! Come on!

1276
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,083
<i>Lamar usually makes that shot
in his sleep.</i>

1277
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,249
<i>The Wildcats up by 14</i>

1278
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,641
<i>with a little bit left
to play in this half.</i>

1279
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,529
<i>Bulldogs back on offence,</i>

1280
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,090
<i>trying to cut into that Wildcat lead.</i>

1281
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,083
<i>Here comes Brodey, right around Allen</i>

1282
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,083
<i>for the double-handed slam!</i>

1283
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,845
<i>That's a hell of a crossover by Brodey.</i>

1284
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,209
That's more like it.
That's what I'm talking about.

1285
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,847
<i>Wildcats up by 12
with nine minutes to go.</i>

1286
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,921
That's no effort, Lamar!

1287
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,604
<i>Fast-break situation. Two on one.</i>

1288
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,284
<i>Allen lob to Aldinger!</i>

1289
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,691
What was that?

1290
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,851
Did you see that?

1291
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,043
<i>Coach also not pleased
with what he saw.</i>

1292
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,208
<i>Chester Moore checking in
for Lamar Allen.</i>

1293
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,966
<i>Coach not happy,
pulling him out of the game.</i>

1294
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,804
<i>Ironically, not to catch his breath</i>

1295
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,962
<i>but to really, I think,
figure out what is happening.</i>

1296
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,122
That's all right. That's all right.
Yeah, Lamar!

1297
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,600
<i>He's blown possession the last four</i>

1298
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,210
<i>times he's touched the ball.
Not what we're used to</i>

1299
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,725
<i>seeing from this kid.</i>

1300
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,326
You're going to watch the game
with me. Take a seat.

1301
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,405
<i>The bench is the great persuader,</i>

1302
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,681
<i>the great teacher.</i>

1303
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,126
<i>And this is what Coach is doing,</i>

1304
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,407
<i>giving Lamar Allen a chance to refocus,</i>

1305
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,726
<i>get his head together.</i>

1306
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,888
<i>Started off the game
with spectacular play,</i>

1307
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,331
<i>but over these past few minutes,</i>

1308
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,370
<i>has not been the Lamar Allen
that we're used to seeing.</i>

1309
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,204
Stay on that bench, Lamar.

1310
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,402
What the hell's wrong with you, Lamar?

1311
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,244
<i>Here comes the Dogs back on of fence.</i>

1312
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,845
<i>He's got Cunningham.</i>

1313
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,524
<i>Cunningham finds Wilhelm in the paint!</i>

1314
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,931
And a foul!

1315
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,724
Take it to the house, motherfucker.

1316
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,202
Yeah, okay, we good, we good.

1317
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:04,927
There you go.

1318
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,771
<i>Look at his face.</i>

1319
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,928
<i>This is humiliating for Lamar Allen...</i>

1320
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,850
<i>...in the conference semi-finals</i>

1321
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,445
<i>against their rivals.</i>

1322
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,282
<i>Bulldogs now have
the lead for the first time!</i>

1323
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,528
<i>And here comes Lamar Allen.</i>

1324
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,440
Stay on the bench, Lamar. Stay
on that fucking bench, Lamar!

1325
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,971
Stay on the fucking bench!

1326
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,970
Lamar!

1327
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,129
<i>Bulldogs score again!</i>

1328
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,129
<i>They now have a three-point lead.</i>

1329
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,482
<i>The fans purring Allen's name,</i>

1330
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,489
<i>looking for him to do something.</i>

1331
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,766
<i>Here comes Allen
on the left-handed drive!</i>

1332
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,331
<i>He's got it.</i>

1333
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,646
Come on!

1334
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,970
What this motherfucker just do?

1335
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,327
<i>Under two minutes to go in the game.</i>

1336
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,001
<i>Here's Lamar Allen looking to
make some magic. Goes around.</i>

1337
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,482
<i>Splits the defence! Throws it
down with a left-handed jam!</i>

1338
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,564
<i>Wildcats have the lead now, 64-63,</i>

1339
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,449
<i>and Allen with another turnaround.</i>

1340
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,086
<i>It is in! Lamar Allen singlehandedly</i>

1341
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,242
<i>going on a 6-0 run!</i>

1342
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,003
<i>Under a minute to go.
Allen throws it down again!</i>

1343
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,163
<i>Wildcats up by 5. This has
been the Lamar Allen show</i>

1344
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,924
<i>in these final minutes.</i>

1345
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,448
<i>Bulldogs miss the lay-up.
Allen's got the rebound.</i>

1346
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,601
Oh, come on!

1347
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,091
He's on fire!

1348
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,286
He's fucking up like that.

1349
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,691
He knows
what he supposed to be doing.

1350
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,529
You say that's your man. He's scoring.

1351
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,130
Yeah, too damn much!

1352
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,850
<i>But that's not what Lamar Allen does.</i>

1353
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,203
<i>Takes it around and to the hole!
Cats up by seven.</i>

1354
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,289
Come on, man.
This some bullshit!

1355
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,005
I told him less than 8.

1356
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,520
<i>Right now, Lamar Allen</i>

1357
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,051
<i>is playing the game of basketball</i>

1358
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,891
<i>at the highest level one can play it.</i>

1359
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,686
Ten...

1360
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,803
Nine, eight,

1361
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,287
seven, six, five,

1362
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:08,042
four, three, two, one.

1363
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,404
Yes, sir!

1364
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,006
Yes, sir!

1365
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,930
Our boy delivered.

1366
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,850
You delivered.

1367
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,045
You know how rare that is?
A man delivers?

1368
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,085
So we square?

1369
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,407
You going to stop threatening the girl?

1370
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,284
How about I tell you, you get to keep

1371
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,926
your job at the university? Forever.

1372
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,727
Just so long as you keep
teaching English 101

1373
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,689
to a whole lot of tall brothers.

1374
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,288
Oh, I'd tell you to kill me.

1375
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,450
Have a drink.

1376
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,091
Don't want one.

1377
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,370
Thanks, sweetheart.

1378
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,801
I see the Koreans fucked your face up.

1379
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,206
Yes, they did.

1380
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,080
And you just move on
to the next phase of bullshit.

1381
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,641
You know,

1382
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,768
the only trouble is with the game today?

1383
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,566
What's that?

1384
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,484
Someone also bet
an eight-point spread in Vegas

1385
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,961
for a whole lot of fucking money.

1386
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,922
You wouldn't happen to know
who did that, would ya?

1387
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,485
No idea.

1388
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,483
You ain't tipped nobody?

1389
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,446
No.

1390
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,488
What's your life's plan, Jim?

1391
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,241
Make part of it never seeing me again.

1392
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,851
I don't need you no more, brother.

1393
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,490
I know that.

1394
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,762
Think I want you out there knowing that?

1395
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,445
Knowing this?

1396
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,160
I'm going to tell you that
I'm not going to do you

1397
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,124
the discourtesy of assuming
what you're thinking,

1398
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,842
but I know you'll do the right thing.

1399
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,805
Why is that?

1400
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,168
That's the whole amount.

1401
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,530
And points.

1402
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,405
Where'd you get that?

1403
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,566
I borrowed it from Frank.

1404
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,011
The fuck you did.

1405
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,891
- Ask him.
- I will.

1406
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,048
Then you will find out that I did.

1407
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,405
You know, Jim,
everybody's ready to be bent.

1408
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,769
Some are ready to be straight.

1409
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,926
Personally, I'm ready to be straight.

1410
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,051
I'm going to get myself an avocado farm.

1411
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,885
Or a winery.

1412
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,923
Do what I got to do, you know?

1413
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,521
Not a huge fan of low company.

1414
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,201
A man can transform his shit, Jim.

1415
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,724
You know, I've never done
anything like this before.

1416
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,404
I mean, I didn't think
I was going to make it

1417
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:41,640
out of there alive, you know.

1418
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,161
Open it.

1419
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,122
Take out 50 grand, that's yours.

1420
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,522
Man, I'm going to have
my fucking picture

1421
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,682
on a Wheaties box within months, dude.

1422
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,325
Suit yourself.

1423
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,327
What was the point
of me going to Vegas?

1424
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,327
Obviously it wasn't to earn 50 grand.

1425
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,604
Time to get away from me, Dexter.
Far away.

1426
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,883
I got your money.
But I'm not coming there.

1427
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,047
You got to meet me.

1428
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,884
<i>Koreatown. You know the place, right?</i>

1429
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,365
Everybody knows the place.

1430
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,209
Whether or not
I want you around that place

1431
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,051
with my money in your hand
is another fucking story.

1432
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,845
<i>Well, that's the only place I'll meet you.</i>

1433
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,041
You have all my money,
plus everything?

1434
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,211
Yeah, I have all your money,

1435
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,011
<i>but I don't have everything.
You got to meet me there.</i>

1436
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,800
What do you do when you're
in the "fuck you" position?

1437
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,241
Oh, we've had that discussion,
and I understand your point,

1438
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,480
but you got to meet me there.

1439
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,322
If there's a list of places
where nobody gets ripped off,

1440
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,562
I believe that's at the top.

1441
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:13,446
- You have my money?
- Yes.

1442
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,245
Then you must come outside.

1443
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,241
No.

1444
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,364
I owe him, too.

1445
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,451
You gonna play?

1446
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,931
It's the only way I could pay you both.

1447
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,526
You can't take the money off me
in here and neither can he.

1448
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,364
Red or black, all or nothing,
all the money down.

1449
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,601
That's all I'll do.

1450
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:34,961
Move.

1451
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,122
Take a very sizable bet?

1452
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,123
That is what this room is for.

1453
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,482
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

1454
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,647
Fuck are you doing?

1455
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,330
All on black.

1456
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:40,520
I was playing for Mister Lee
and for that gentleman over there.

1457
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,688
I'm not actually a gambler.

1458
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,681
Keys are in the car.

1459
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,205
You don't need a ride?

1460
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,124
No, I'll walk.
I feel like walking.

1461
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,765
What do you got on you?

1462
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,605
Not a fucking cent.

1463
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,444
That's not a "fuck you" position.

1464
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,131
Oh, yes, it is.

1465
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,531
Here's your $100,000.

1466
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,046
Turns out there was
a little extra cream on top.

1467
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,451
On me.

1468
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:33,926
Fuck you.

1469
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,480
Good boy.
